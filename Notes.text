Could someone please guide me on how to add a common parameter that can be shared across all datasets in a Databricks dashboard?

To add a common parameter across all datasets in a Databricks dashboard, start by defining the parameter in a widget using dbutils.widgets, setting its value globally.
Apply the parameter within SQL queries or Python scripts to ensure consistent data filtering across all datasets.
Ensure the parameter is securely managed by restricting access using fine-grained IAM policies or role-based controls.
Use the parameter in queries in a way that avoids injection vulnerabilities, maintaining best practices for secure code.
This approach allows efficient sharing of the parameter across the dashboard while incorporating security considerations.

Steps we took:

1- define different parameters to avoid conflict per dataset
2- tie the UI filter to these parameters on the lakeview dashboard.

Ensuring the data type for all filters are the same
